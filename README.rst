Synoptic is "GMail for your notes". It gives you an efficient and friendly
interface that makes it possible to keep and categorize a *large* number of
small-ish notes and tidbits of information.

The following features set it apart:

* **Fully versioned.** Never deletes *anything*, *ever*. If you want to go back
  to a previous version of something, just drag that slider up there in the
  top-left corner.

* **Super-simple Navigation.** Adaptive tag clouds, 
  support for the forward/back button on your browser, 
  query links, support for browser bookmarks. All to make sure
  you can find that note when you need it.

* **Powerful searching.** Synoptic is meant to keep *large*
  note collections manageable and accessible. You can search for items
  based on tags, their creation time, or even search through their *full text*. 
  Plus arbitrary logical combinations of them, using the 
  logical operatos and, or, and not.

* **Easy Markup.** Synoptic uses
  Markdown to allow you to type formatted notes easily and
  quickly. Plus, there are a few extensions to facilitate
  typing math.

* **Advanced Features.** A lot of refinement work has gone into
  making Synoptic work as seamlessly as possible. You may never notice
  many of these refinements, because they're meant to make stuff work like
  it's supposed to.
