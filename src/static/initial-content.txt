#Welcome to Synoptic!

Synoptic is "GMail for your notes". It gives you an efficient and friendly
interface that makes it possible to keep and categorize a *large* number of
small-ish notes and tidbits of information.

The following features set it apart:

* **Fully versioned.** Never deletes *anything*, *ever*. If you want to go back
to a previous version of something, just drag that slider up there in the
top-left corner.

* **[Super-simple Navigation](#navigation).** Adaptive tag clouds, 
support for the forward/back button on your browser, 
[query links](#link), support for browser bookmarks. All to make sure
you can find that note when you need it.

* **[Powerful search](#search).** Synoptic is meant to keep *large*
note collections manageable and accessible. You can search for items
based on tags, their creation time, or even search through their *full
text*. Plus arbitrary logical combinations of them, using the 
logical operatos `and`, `or`, and `not`.

* **[Easy Markup](#markup).** Synoptic uses
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) to allow you to
type formatted notes easily and quickly. Plus, there are a few 
[extensions](#markup extension) to facilitate typing math.

* **[Advanced Features](#advanced).** A lot of refinement work has gone into
making Synoptic work as seamlessly as possible. You may never notice
many of these refinements, because they're meant to make stuff work like
it's supposed to. If you're curious nonetheless, take a [peek](#advanced).

You can also see what's [changed since the last release](#changes) or browse
the [Frequently Asked Questions](#faq). Curious who cooked this up?
Check the [credits](#credits). Also make sure you understand the
[licensing](#license).

# Keyboard Navigation

When navigating:

* **J**, **K**: move down/up.
* **E**, **Shift-D**: edit/delete.
* **S**, **/**: jump to the search bar.
* **N**: create a new note.
* **C**: toggle collapsed state.

When your cursor is in the search field, just hit **Enter** to return
to the usual navigation mode.

When editing:

* **Alt-Shift-O** to hit OK.
* **Alt-Shift-C** to cancel.

(those are valid for Firefox, other browsers treat access keys differently.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS: advanced,ordering
# Reordering Items

You can sort notes by dragging their header bar. 

Synoptic will remember the order and show the items in the same order
the next time you use the same search query. In fact, it doesn't have
to be literally the same search query. If, within limits, synoptic can
infer that your queries are logically equivalent, synoptic will use
the existing ordering.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS: advanced,wsgi
# Use your notes from anywhere

Synoptic is, at its core, just a [WSGI](http://wsgi.org) application.
Install it on your web server, put some form of authentication in front
of it, and *cha-ching*: you have worldwide notes.

To make your integration job easier, a sample WSGI wrapper script that
should be usable with `mod_wsgi` is included as `doc/sample.wsgi`.

For now, synoptic must run in the root directory of its web server.
I will gladly accept patches to fix that, it shouldn't be hard.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS: advanced,history
# Dealing with History

Once you travel away from the "present" view of your notes, all the
editing features go away. The past is immutable, you might say. :)

However, each item gets two new buttons: *Revert* and *Copy to
present*. Upon clicking either of these, you will find a copy of that
note once you return to the present. In the case of "Revert", it will
have replaced whatever state the same note was in in the "present", and
with "Copy", there will simply be another copy of it, leaving the
current state of the note well alone.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Credits

Synoptic was cooked up by [Andreas Klöckner](http://mathema.tician.de) while
procrastinating from his PhD. (Well, I needed a better note taking tool for my
research. :-)

It stands on the shoulders of the following giants:

* [Python](http://www.python.org), the programming language.
* [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org), the storage engine. Comes with Python nowadays.
* [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org), the Object-Relational Mapper and performer of incredible SQL magic.
* [Python Paste](http://pythonpaste.org/), bits of usefulness for WSGI.
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), makes hacking Javascript fun again. *[included, with several plugins]*
* [Python Markdown](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/), the Wiki syntax *[included]*
* [SimpleJSON](http://www.undefined.org/python/), a Python/JSON interface.
* [Parsedatetime](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/parsedatetime/), a natural-language date parser.
* [Setuptools](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools) automatically pulls together all these dependencies so alll you have to type to install synoptic is `easy_install synoptic`.
* [Tango Icon Theme](http://tango.freedesktop.org), the pretty pictures you click on.
* [reallysimplehistory](http://code.google.com/p/reallysimplehistory/), browser history management from Javascript.

and lastly:

* Synoptic needs a decent, compliant browser.
[Firefox](http://getfirefox.com) is my main target, but [other
browsers](#faq browsers) also work, at least to some extent.

In part to say thank you to the people who wrote these amazing pieces
of software and everybody supporting Open Source, Synoptic is released

# Getting Started

You can get started right here! Just delete all these startup notes that are
already here, and start your own set of notes. Should you want to come back to
these notes, just slide the history slider to the somewhere near the left edge.

*Remember:* They're not gone when you delete them!

(If you'd rather start from a clean slate, remove this database,
and start synoptic with the `--start-empty` command line option.)

# Navigating with Tags

Perhaps the most convenient way of navigating within synoptic is 
the adaptive tag cloud on the left. Given your current search, it shows
you the tags that you can "drill down" to, i.e. tags that are used
in the items in your current view. Click on them, and your view will
restrict to only the items using the tag you clicked.

In addition, the tags you are currently searching for are shown in
red. Click those, and that tag will be taken out of your search.

If you need access to a tag that's not in your current query, you may
use the "All tags" tab on the left.

Also try right-clicking on those tags. (Caution: Some Firefox mouse
gesture extensions break right-clicks in web applications.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS: tags,navigation,advanced
# Using Hidden Tags

You can create hidden tags. If a tag starts with a dot ("."), it won't
show up in the tag cloud by default. (If you've used UNIX file systems
before, this should sound familiar.) Unless you click the "show hidden"
checkbox, that is.

The purpose of this feature is to maintain the usefulness of the tag
cloud even if you want a *lot* of different tags (such as tagging stuff
by the date it happened).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS: tags,navigation,advanced
# The `home` tag

When you enter an empty search query, synoptic will show you everything
tagged with `home`. You'll tend to see this screen quite a bit, so you
can use it for stuff you would like to keep in view prominently, such
as your main to-do list, or links to different views that you use
frequently.

# Basics of Markup Syntax

Markdown's basic idea is to turn plain-text email conventions into real
HTML markup.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS: markup, character
# Markdown Character Formats
You can *emphasize* text by surrounding it with `*asterisks*`.

You can **strongly emphasize** text by surrounding it with `**double asterisks**`.

You can show text `verbatim` by surrounding it with backticks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS: markup, character, link, faq
# How do I link to the web? Or to synoptic search results?

To create a link, simply enter `[title](http://url/)`. You may also 
link to a synoptic [search result](#search), by entering `#my search query`
for the URL. This documentation is full of examples of this technique.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS: markup,extension
# Extra Character Formats

If you surround some text with \~\~`double tildes`\~\~, it will appear
~~like this~~.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS: markup, paragraph
# Markdown Paragraph Formats
Unordered lists are produced like this:

    * Apples
    * Oranges
    * Bananas

To quote a block of literal text, simply indent it by four spaces:

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
      return 0;
    }

A heading (or subheading) is produced like this:

    # My Page title
    ## My Section Title
    ### My Subsection Title

For the full story, check out the [Markdown syntax
basics][mdbasics] and the [full specification][mdspec]. In addition,
Markdown is HTML-transparent. If something is not represented within
its syntax (such as tables), just enter the corresponding HTML.

# Magic HTML Entities

If you need a special symbol, you can of course type out the
HTML `&entity;`, and it will show up as you want. There's a better
way, though: If you type the same entity as \\`entity`, then synoptic
will replace that with the corresponding Unicode character when saving
your note item. That way, the symbol will not only show up "right" 
when viewed as HTML, but also when editing.

Here are some examples:

* \sum is \\`sum`.
* \int is \\`int`.
* \alpha is \\`alpha`.

TAGS: faq, browsers
# What Browsers are supported?

You'll likely have most fun with [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com). However,
synoptic is usable to some extent in most browsers. Here's a list of
them, with a list of problems:

* Opera 9: works, no keyboard shortcuts.
* Konqueror: works, but scrolling the note by anything other
than the scroll bar is broken.
* IE: Not tried.

I'd be happy to take patches that fix these compatibility issues.

TAGS: search,syntax,primitives,tags
# Searching for Tags

A search for a tag is entered simply as `mytag`, without quotes.
You may combine several such searches simply by stringing them 
together, as you do in Google. Examples:

* `research ideas`
* `todo life`

Prefixing a tag with a minus sign (`-mytag`) searches for all notes
*not* having that tag. Examples:

* `research ideas -todo`
* `python2.5 -issues`

You can search for all tags matching a wildcard, by typing `my*tag` 
or `my???tag`. An asterisk (`*`) can stand for an arbitrary number
of characters (including zero), while a question mark (`?`) may
be replaced by exactly one character. Here are some examples:
search for date-tagged objects:

* .meeting.2008.04.??
* .meeting.2008.*
* python2.?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS: search,syntax,primitives,fulltext
# Searching for Full Text

Searching for text contained in an item's body is achieved by 
typing (`"query string"`) If you would like to search for multiple 
words, but not necessarily in sequence, enclose them in quotes
individually.

Examples:

* `"heat transfer"`
* `"andreas" "weird"`

Full-text search is not case sensitive.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS: search,syntax,primitives,date
# Searching by Time and Date of Last Modification

You may restrict your view to items modified before or after a
specific point in time, by using `before(...)` and `after(...)`, 
where `...` is a natural-language representation of the desired
date.

Examples:

* `after(yesterday 5pm)`
* `before(Apr 5 2008)`

Check out the [parsedatetime](http://code.google.com/p/parsedatetime/)
page for the many different ways you can specify a point in time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS: search,syntax,operators,advanced
# Advanced Searching with Logical Operators

You may combine [simple searches](#search primitives) into more
advanced queries by combining them using the logical operators `and`,
`or` and `not`. Parentheses are supported, too.

If no operator is specified between separate simple searches,
`and` is silently added.

Examples:

* `tag1 and tag2`
* `tag1 tag2`
* `tag1 and (tag2 or tag3)`
* `-tag3 and "fulltext"`
* `not tag3 and "fulltext"`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAGS: faq, search
# How do I search for all my notes?

Enter a tautological query, such as `"blah or -blah"`. If you have many notes,
rendering all of them might take a while, so be patient.
